def handle(payload: PayloadType) -> float:
    """
    Handles sum operations on a payload containing numbers.
    This function attempts to compute the sum of numbers from the provided payload. 
    It first tries to directly apply the built-in sum() function to the payload. 
    If a TypeError is encountered (for example, when the payload is a comma-separated string 
    rather than a list of numbers), it logs a warning, splits the payload string by commas, 
    converts each segment to a float, and then computes the sum. 
    Any other unexpected exceptions are logged before a ValueError is raised.

    Parameters:
        payload (str): A string representing either an iterable of numbers or a comma-separated list of numbers.
    Returns:
        float: The sum of the numbers extracted from the payload.
    Raises:
        ValueError: If the payload format is invalid or cannot be processed.
