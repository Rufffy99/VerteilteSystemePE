def handle_request(data, addr, sock):
    """
    Handles an incoming network request for worker registration, lookup, or deregistration.
    Parameters:
        data (bytes): The raw incoming message data to be decoded.
        addr (tuple): The address (IP, port) of the client that sent the request.
        sock (socket.socket): The socket object used to send the response back to the client.
    Behavior:
        - Decodes the incoming data to determine the message type and its associated content.
        - For a REGISTER_WORKER message:
              * Extracts the worker type and address from the content.
              * Registers the worker by adding an entry to the global registry.
              * Sends a confirmation response indicating successful registration.
        - For a LOOKUP_WORKER message:
              * Looks up the worker address in the registry based on the provided worker type.
              * Sends the workerâ€™s address if found, otherwise sends an error indicating that no worker was found.
        - For a DEREGISTER_WORKER message:
              * Finds and removes all registry entries matching the provided worker address.
              * Sends a response indicating how many entries were deregistered.
        - For any other message types:
              * Sends an error response indicating an unknown message type.
    Side Effects:
        - Modifies the global registry in the case of registration and deregistration requests.
        - Sends a response message to the client using sock.sendto().

    Run the name service by binding a UDP socket to the configured HOST and PORT and listening for incoming requests.

        1. Creates a UDP socket.

        3. Enters an infinite loop to listen for data on the socket.

    Notes:
        - The run_nameservice function assumes that the variables HOST and PORT are defined externally.
        - The handle_request function should be implemented to process each request appropriately.
