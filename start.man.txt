    It handles Docker Compose generation, builds, cleanups, and container orchestration in a controlled way.

            --no-cache    Build Docker images without using cache.
            --detach, -d  Run containers in the background.

    run
        Use an existing docker-compose.generated.yml to start the containers.

        Options:
            --detach, -d  Run containers in the background.

    regen-compose
        Regenerate docker-compose.generated.yml without starting or building anything.
