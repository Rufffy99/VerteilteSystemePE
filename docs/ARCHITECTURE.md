# TaskGrid+ ‚Äì System Architecture

This document describes the architectural structure, design principles, and responsibilities of each component within the TaskGrid+ distributed task processing system.

## üîß Component Responsibilities

### 1. Client
- Sends tasks to Dispatcher via `POST_TASK`
- Queries results by Task ID via `GET_RESULT`
- CLI interface for user interaction

### 2. Dispatcher
- Receives tasks and enqueues them
- Resolves the appropriate Worker using NameService
- Dispatches tasks to Worker via UDP
- Stores results and responds to result queries

### 3. Worker
- Registers itself with the NameService at startup
- Receives task, processes it using a handler (e.g., `reverse.py`)
- Sends the result back to Dispatcher
- Supports dynamic extension by adding modules to `worker_types/`

### 4. NameService
- Maintains a dynamic registry of worker type ‚Üí address mappings
- Responds to Dispatcher `LOOKUP_WORKER` and Worker `REGISTER_WORKER` messages

### 5. Monitoring
- Provides system insights over a REST API
- Exposes number of workers, queue size, processing time (future extensible)

## üîÅ Communication Design

- All communication is UDP-based using JSON-encoded messages
- Messages follow a standard structure with:
  - `type` (e.g., "POST_TASK")
  - `data` (payload with task or metadata)
- Each component runs in its own Docker container

## üß© Modularity & Extensibility

- Adding new task types is as simple as dropping a `.py` file into `worker_types/`
- Worker dispatch logic is decoupled from the Dispatcher ‚Äî supports horizontal scaling
- Components can be replaced or extended without breaking the communication protocol

## üì¶ Container-Oriented Architecture

- Docker Compose handles orchestration and service naming
- Services resolve each other via DNS (e.g., `nameservice`, `dispatcher`)
- Shared volume (optional) for logging and testing

## üìù Design Rationale

- UDP was chosen for lightweight, stateless communication
- Decentralized processing via Workers allows scaling and isolation
- NameService provides runtime flexibility instead of static configuration
